# Divide-HISTORY
Divide HISTORY file which is trajectory of MD simulations forom DL_POLY program package.
The original code is named "Divide-History" which is a python code. It can divide your trajectory in 3 different modes:
1. contiuous dividing, for example, divide 100-conformation HISTORY file to 100 of one conformations or 50 of 2-conformation and so on.
2. continuous dividing with skipping some conformations
3. evenly spaced divide, for example, give you 100-conformation which are evenly spaced picked from 1000-conformation HISTORY file
